### Tic-Tac-Go

A simple 2-player implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe written in Go. There is no game engine other than detection of a win or a cat's game.

**Installation**

For Unix systems:

1. Install Go on your computer.
2. Create a new directory, say, `tic-tac-go`
3. Clone this repo (`go-projects`) into that directory and run it:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fukubukuro/go-projects.git
$ cd go-projects/src/tic-tac-go
$ go run ./main.go
```

Windows users will want to make the typical Windowsy adaptations to the above.
